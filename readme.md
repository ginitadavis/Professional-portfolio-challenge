# Second Challenge Professional Portfolio

## Description

In the second challenge of the course I had to create a website from scratch, there was no starter code provided. 
I created a webpage with three main sections. The first section contains the name, picture of the author and the navigation bar. The second section contains information about the author and the professional portfolio. The third section is the contact information.

My motivation was to complete a finish product with a professional look from scratch, while learning to apply concepts learned in class such as the flexbox and css variables.


## Usage

My Professional Portfolio

Navigate through the webpage using the navigation bar located at the top of the page. "About Me" directs you to the first block of the page. "My Work" directs you to the demonstrations of work of the author as the "Study Guide" and the "Horiseon First Challenge", the rest of the cards are placeholders. "My Resume" directs you to the author's resume, and "Contact Me" directs you to the last block of the page with the author's contact information.
